# mindmybaby
This web site was developed on my secound year studying computing science. For this project was used PHP, javascript, html, CSS and mysql. The main gol of this project was learn how to integrate frontend, backend and database. It wasn't required by the college but I upload the website online to learn how to do it. 
the website is avaible on: https://mindmybaby.000webhostapp.com/swd_assignment03_designed/home.html

On the second year studing computing science at Griffith College Dublin was introduce to all students the coding language PHP. This project was used to teach students how to use frontend, backend and database.
It was develeped in group of three people. I developed backend and mysql also hosted online, but it could not be done without our team, because another gol for this assigment is team work. We learnt how to distribute tasks, follow schedule and help each other.
This project contains few bugs that I will fix in the future.
Many of the coding could be improved witch I plan to do soon.

backend: PHP, javascript
frontend: HTML, CSS
